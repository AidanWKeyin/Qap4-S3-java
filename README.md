Project Description

This Java project demonstrates how to persist and retrieve data using two common approaches: file I/O and JDBC database access. It features two custom entity classes:

Drug — saved to and read from a local text file (drugs.txt)
Patient — inserted into and retrieved from a PostgreSQL database using JDBC
A simple CLI menu allows the user to choose between saving or reading data from either storage method. The goal is to practice Java persistence techniques and reinforce understanding of object-oriented programming, file handling, and database connectivity.

## How it went: 
- JDBC Cannot be downloading on my mac, it says it is considered malware. spent hours looking for numerous version. 

- Github also didnt want to push anything from my first repo so sorry for only one commit here had to make a new repo.
